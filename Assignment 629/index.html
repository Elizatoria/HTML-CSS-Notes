    <h1>Facts about the Cybertronian Batman</h1>
    <p>Before the war, Ratbat was a famous self-help guru well known for his motivational audio programs and seminars such as "Unlimited Fuel: Awaken the Gestalt Within". But now that the war has caused those products to fall out of favor, Ratbat spends his time instead convincing his salesmen to sell his maintenance and aesthetic products. What he doesn't tell them is that he actually makes all of his money off selling them his old tapes.</p>

    <p>Although he promotes himself as being a drinker of high-quality oils, in fact he has a scandalous addiction to low-grade energon. However, there seems to be another side of Ratbat. Something that lurks on rooftops while lightning flashes ominously in the background. Something nocturnal. Something vengeful...</p>

    <p>By day, mild-mannered philanthropist Ratbat portrays a public image of inebriation and frivolity. At dusk, however, he is vengeance. He is the night. He...is...BATBOT! The Batbot signal resulted in him rendezvousing with Commissioner Garboil on a rooftop. Garboil reported that Blackcat had escaped from G9, but before Batbot could go and investigate, he needed Garboil and Howlback to turn around so he could execute another of his mysterious disappearing acts. Ratbat appeared on Slamdance's show to give his opinion of Batbot. He was alarmed when Slamdance put up a file photo of Batbot next to him, and requested it be taken down.</p>

    <p>Arriving on a parallel Earth, Batbot set out to find his evil counterpart there. He ran into Rumble and Frenzy, who broke the news that his alternate self was dead. After he asked them if evil Ratbat had unfinished business, they directed him to Ratbat's quarters in which a stack of paperwork was waiting to be done. Unable to solve Blackcat's riddles, Batbot was suspended over a vat of boiling liquid. When Slugfest came crashing through the wall to his rescue, Batbot was surprised by Blackcat's immediate surrender as it was "only Slugfest." Confronted by positive universe Howlback who was offended by his crusade against evil, Batbot found he had Nightprowler on his side.</p>

    <p>Following the disruptive arrival of another universe's Earth, Soundwave attempted to repair the fried planetary electrical systems on his universe's Earth as Slugfest failed to help and Bat-Bot stood watch. Suddenly Bat-Bot signaled that interlopers had arrived, Blaster and his brethren Rewind and Ramhorn. Bat-Bot singled out Rewind for battle. Temporarily, Blaster ingested the captive stranger Solarbot and began attacking everyone with solar flares, until Solarbot overwhelmed Blaster and left his body. As Blaster and his tapes fled, Bat-Bot and the other Decepticons welcomed Solarbot to their ranks</p>

    <h2>IDW Publications</h2>
    <p>Ratbat attended one of Megatron's anti-empurata rallies until Megatron's dispute with security officer Prowl turned violent. According to Starscream, this incident played a role in Ratbat's eventual election to the Cybertronian Senate, although Megatron opined that his time as a senator did little to advance the Decepticon cause.</p>
